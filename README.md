**Simple but Strong **

On the devices level, every computer with an OS can be the server. Client, as you can see, every one can also be the client.

On the program level, both of them are a running program. Therefore, on one computer we can set up a S/C model to provide services.

Basical, the role of them is just corp with their name. Server and client. For example,  a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) serves [web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) and a [file server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server) serves [computer files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file).

## Connection and Communication

Demo 1 [python server + web browser]

Demo 2 [nginx  +  mysql +  [phpmyadmin](https://demo.phpmyadmin.net/master-config/index.php) 

Basic networking techs is used to do such a thing.  You will find more when you're dealing with different server model.
